### [Documentation](./Documentation/)
Additional documentation and visual guides for implementing context engineering principles in your projects.

## Quick Start

1. **Choose Your Platform**: Start with LinkedIn (default) or adapt for your target platform
2. **Read the Framework**: Review `StoryTelling/README.md` for the complete methodology
3. **Study Examples**: Examine `StoryTelling/EXAMPLES.md` for proven story structures
4. **Use the Templates**: Apply `StoryTelling/AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` for AI generation
5. **Customize**: Adapt the guidelines for your specific use case and audience

## Story Generation Process

### 1. Input
Any technical or conceptual question, such as:
- "What's the first step to finding real-world DDD concepts?"
- "How do we avoid overcomplicating early domain models?"
- "What one convention saved us the most time later?"

### 2. Framework Application
Follow the 3-part structure:
- **Main Value** (20-30 words): Bold, clear opening statement
- **Story Body** (120-140 words): Specific scene with emotional connection
- **Call to Action** (30-40 words): Actionable advice or reflection question

### 3. Output
LinkedIn-ready story (≤200 words) that:
- Shows rather than tells
- Creates emotional resonance
- Provides actionable value
- Engages the target audience

## Example Output

**Question**: "What one convention saved us the most time later?"

**Generated Story**:
> The most valuable hour we spent wasn't writing code. It was agreeing on how to name things.
> 
> Day one of the project, our tech lead stopped us. "Before we write a single line, we're deciding on naming conventions." We groaned. We had features to ship.
> 
> She opened a doc: "Boolean methods start with 'is' or 'has'. Event handlers end with 'Handler'. No abbreviations unless they're industry standard."
> 
> Seemed trivial. But three months later, a new developer joined. She opened our codebase and said, "I can guess what everything does before I read it."
> 
> No hour-long explanations needed. No "what does this variable mean?" questions in every code review. The patterns were consistent. Predictable.
> 
> **Spend an hour documenting your team's naming conventions before your next project. Future you—and everyone who joins after—will thank you for the hundreds of hours you'll save in confusion and clarification.**
