# TXT Format Guide for Generated Stories

## Single File Approach

All generated stories are **appended to a single `.txt` file** instead of creating separate files. This approach provides:

### Benefits:
✅ **Centralized collection** - All stories in one place
✅ **Easy browsing** - Scroll through all stories in one file
✅ **Simple management** - No multiple files to track
✅ **Append-only** - Never lose previous stories
✅ **Universal compatibility** - Opens on any device, any platform
✅ **Easy copying** - Each story ready to copy-paste to social media
✅ **Clean transfer** - Direct copy-paste to LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc.
✅ **Version history** - See evolution of your content over time

## File Name

### Single File:
```
Generated_Stories.txt
```

This is the **only file** you'll create. All stories get appended to this file with clear separators.

## Content Structure in Single File

### Story Entry Format:

Each story entry in `Generated_Stories.txt` follows this format:

```
================================================================================
QUESTION: [The question this story answers]
DATE: [YYYY-MM-DD]
PLATFORM: [LinkedIn/Twitter/etc.]
WORD COUNT: [###]
HASHTAGS: [#code #software #topic #chanchito]
================================================================================

[Opening hook - 1-2 punchy sentences]

[Story paragraph 1 - Quick scene setup]

[Story paragraph 2 - The problem with specifics]

[Story paragraph 3 - The lesson]

[Call to action - Direct advice]

#code #software #topic #chanchito

================================================================================


```

**Note**: Hashtags appear BOTH in metadata (for tracking) and at end of story content (for posting).

### Formatting Rules:

1. **Story Separator**: Use `=` line (80 characters) before and after each story
2. **Metadata Header**: Include question, date, platform, word count
3. **Paragraphs**: Single blank line between paragraphs within the story
4. **Story Spacing**: Three blank lines between stories
5. **No markdown**: No `#`, `**`, `*`, `-`, or other markdown syntax
6. **Plain text only**: Just words, punctuation, and line breaks
7. **Emphasis**: Use natural language emphasis, not formatting

## Example File Content

**Filename**: `Generated_Stories.txt`

**Content**:
```
================================================================================
QUESTION: What one convention saved us the most time later?
DATE: 2025-10-10
PLATFORM: LinkedIn
WORD COUNT: 196
================================================================================

The most valuable hour we spent wasn't writing code. It was agreeing on how to name things.

My co-founder and I were starting our first freelancing project together—a restaurant management system. Day one, we opened the codebase.

He wrote handleBtnClick. I wrote onButtonPressed. He used usr for users. I spelled it out. His event handlers ended in Handler. Mine started with on.

"We need to decide this now," he said. "Before we have 50 files."

We groaned. We had features to ship. But we spent an hour: Boolean methods start with is or has. Event handlers end with Handler. No abbreviations unless they're industry standard. Components use PascalCase. Variables use camelCase.

Three months later, a bug came in. I jumped into his code. Instantly knew what every function did before reading it. Fixed it in ten minutes.

Six months later, we onboarded a developer. She said, "I can navigate this without asking questions. Everything's predictable."

Spend an hour documenting your team's naming conventions before your next project. That one hour will save you hundreds in confusion, code reviews, and onboarding. Future you will thank you.

================================================================================


================================================================================
QUESTION: What happens when you skip early agreement on code style?
DATE: 2025-10-10
PLATFORM: LinkedIn
WORD COUNT: 195
================================================================================

We lost two days to a merge conflict that wasn't about code. It was about spaces.

## Optional: Metadata Comments

You can include metadata as comments at the bottom (for internal use):

```
[Story content here]

---
Word Count: 196
Context: Freelancing project
Platform: LinkedIn
Date Generated: 2025-10-10
```

**Note**: When copying to social media, exclude the metadata section.

## Working with the Single File

### Creating Stories:
1. Generate story using AI prompt template
2. **Append** to `Generated_Stories.txt` (never create new file)
3. Add metadata header with separator
4. Include story content
5. Add closing separator and spacing

### Using Stories:
1. Open `Generated_Stories.txt` in any text editor
2. Find the story you want to post (use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F to search by question)
3. **Select only the story content** (skip the metadata header and separators)
4. Copy (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
5. Paste directly into social media platform
6. Post!

### File Organization:
```
Generated_Stories/
└── Generated_Stories.txt  ← Single file with ALL stories
```

**Note**: The `Generated_Stories/` folder contains only ONE file. All stories are appended to this file.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### LinkedIn:
- Copy directly from `.txt`
- Formatting will be preserved automatically
- Line breaks transfer cleanly

### Twitter/X:
- May need to adjust line breaks for thread format
- Each tweet can be a separate `.txt` file

### Instagram:
- Copy caption from `.txt`
- Pair with visual content

### Facebook:
- Copy directly from `.txt`
- Works perfectly with newlines

## Automation Example

If you're building tools to generate stories programmatically:

```python
def append_story_to_file(story_content: str, question: str, platform: str = "LinkedIn", 
                         word_count: int = None, output_dir: str = "Generated_Stories"):
    """
    Append a generated story to the single Generated_Stories.txt file
    
    Args:
        story_content: The story text
        question: The question this story answers
        platform: Target platform (default: LinkedIn)
        word_count: Word count of the story (auto-calculated if None)
        output_dir: Directory containing the file
    """
    import os
    from datetime import datetime
    
    # Create output directory if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Single filename
    filepath = os.path.join(output_dir, "Generated_Stories.txt")
    
    # Calculate word count if not provided
    if word_count is None:
        word_count = len(story_content.split())
    
    # Get current date
    date_str = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    
    # Create story entry with metadata and separators
    separator = "=" * 80
    entry = f"\n{separator}\n"
    entry += f"QUESTION: {question}\n"
    entry += f"DATE: {date_str}\n"
    entry += f"PLATFORM: {platform}\n"
    entry += f"WORD COUNT: {word_count}\n"
    entry += f"{separator}\n\n"
    entry += story_content
    entry += f"\n\n{separator}\n\n\n"
    
    # Append to file (creates file if it doesn't exist)
    with open(filepath, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(entry)
    
    print(f"Story appended to: {filepath}")
    return filepath

# Usage
story = generate_story("What one convention saved us the most time?")
append_story_to_file(
    story_content=story,
    question="What one convention saved us the most time?",
    platform="LinkedIn",
    word_count=196
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Single file only**: Always append to `Generated_Stories.txt`, never create new files
2. **Use separators**: Always include the metadata header and separator lines
3. **Include metadata**: Question, date, platform, and word count for each story
4. **UTF-8 encoding**: Ensures emoji and special characters work
5. **Version control**: Commit `Generated_Stories.txt` to git (unlike the Business folder)
6. **Backup regularly**: The single file contains all your stories—back it up!
7. **Keep it simple**: Plain text is the point
8. **Search-friendly**: Use descriptive question text for easy Ctrl+F searching

## Quality Check Before Appending

Before appending to `Generated_Stories.txt`, verify:
- [ ] No markdown formatting (`#`, `**`, `*`, etc.)
- [ ] Proper line breaks between paragraphs within story
- [ ] Word count ≤ 200 words
- [ ] Metadata header included (question, date, platform, word count)
- [ ] Proper separators (80 `=` characters)
- [ ] Three blank lines after closing separator
- [ ] Content is complete and ready to post
- [ ] UTF-8 encoding if using special characters

## Searching Stories in Single File

To find specific stories in `Generated_Stories.txt`:

### By Question:
1. Open file in text editor
2. Use Ctrl+F (Windows) or Cmd+F (Mac)
3. Search for keywords from the question
4. Example: Search "convention" to find all stories about conventions

### By Date:
1. Search for "DATE: 2025-10-10" format
2. Find all stories generated on a specific date

### By Platform:
1. Search for "PLATFORM: LinkedIn"
2. Find all stories for a specific platform

### By Word Count Range:
1. Search for "WORD COUNT: 19" 
2. Find stories in the 190-199 range

## Summary

**Remember**: 
- **One file only**: All stories go in `Generated_Stories.txt`
- **Always append**: Never create new files, never overwrite
- **Use separators**: Include metadata and separator lines
- **Easy to search**: Use Ctrl+F to find stories by question, date, or platform
- **Easy to copy**: Select just the story content (skip metadata) and paste to social media
- **Backup important**: One file has all your stories—don't lose it!

The single-file approach keeps everything organized, searchable, and manageable while maintaining the simplicity and portability of plain text.
