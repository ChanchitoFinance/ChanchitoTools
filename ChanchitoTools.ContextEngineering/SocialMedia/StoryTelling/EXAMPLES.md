## Example 1: Finding Real-World DDD Concepts

**Question**: "What's the first step to finding real-world DDD concepts?"

---

**The best domain models don't start in code. They start in conversations you haven't had yet.**

I spent two weeks designing an "Order Processing System." Classes, interfaces, sequence diagrams—beautiful architecture. Then the warehouse manager looked at my screen and frowned.

"That's not how it works," she said. "We don't process orders. We receive picks, fulfill them, stage them, then ship them. Completely different systems."

I'd built an entire model around a word nobody in the warehouse ever used. My "Order" object was trying to be four different things at once.

We scrapped it. Started over. This time I spent a day just listening. No laptop. No whiteboard. Just: "Walk me through your day."

The real domain appeared in their verbs, not my nouns.

**Next time you're stuck on a model, close your laptop. Find the person who lives in that domain every day. Ask them to show you, not explain. The concepts will emerge in how they talk, gesture, and solve problems.**

## Example 2: Avoiding Overcomplicated Models

**Question**: "How do we avoid overcomplicating early domain models?"

---

**The most expensive code I ever wrote was perfectly designed for problems we never had.**

My teammate was three days into building a "flexible, extensible user preference system." Abstract factories, strategy patterns, a configuration DSL. I asked what problem we were solving.

"Users can toggle dark mode," he said.

"That's it?"

"For now. But what if they want to customize colors later? Or themes? Or—"

I pulled up the analytics. Dark mode had 43 requests. Custom themes? Zero.

We'd been here before. Six months ago, we built a "scalable notification framework" with twelve classes. It handled email. Just email. We'd spent two weeks preparing for SMS, push notifications, webhooks—none of which we built.

We deleted his three days of work. Wrote a boolean column called `dark_mode`. Shipped it in an hour.

Sometimes the right answer is admitting you don't know what you'll need yet.

**Build for the problem in front of you, not the imaginary problems behind it. You can always refactor when real requirements arrive—and you'll do it better because you'll know what you actually need.**

## Example 3: Modeling Values That Change Over Time

**Question**: "How do we model values that change over time (like score)?"

---

**Time isn't just a timestamp. It's the story of how things changed—and sometimes, that story matters more than the current state.**

The bug report was simple: "User score doesn't match." I checked the database. The score was right. I marked it "cannot reproduce."

Three more reports came in. Same issue. Users swore their score was wrong, but the database disagreed. Then someone asked: "wrong now, or wrong yesterday?"

We'd been overwriting the score every time it changed. Current value? Always accurate. Historical value? Gone forever.

When a user disputed their score, we had nothing to show them. When we needed to audit score changes, we couldn't. When marketing asked "how quickly do scores improve?"—we had no answer.

We changed one thing: stopped replacing the score and started appending events. Now we don't store "score: 85." We store "scored 10 points on quiz X at timestamp Y."

The score is whatever it is when you replay the events.

**If you're storing a value that changes and might need to explain *why* it changed, don't update it—append to it. Current state is just one question. History answers all the others.**

## Example 4: Understanding Bounded Contexts

**Question**: "How do I know when I need separate bounded contexts?"

---

**The word meant three different things in three different meetings. That's when I knew we needed boundaries.**

"Customer wants a refund." Simple sentence. But in the support team meeting, "customer" meant the person emailing us. In the finance meeting, it meant the billing account. In the warehouse, it meant the shipping address.

Same word. Three different concerns. Three different "truths."

We'd built one giant Customer table trying to satisfy everyone. Support wanted communication history. Finance wanted payment methods. Warehouse wanted delivery instructions. The table had forty-seven columns, and nobody could agree on what "customer status" meant.

We split it. Support got "Inquirer." Finance got "BillingAccount." Warehouse got "Recipient." Suddenly, three teams stopped arguing over the same model.

Each context speaks its own language now. When they need to communicate, they translate at the boundary.

**When the same word means different things to different teams—and both meanings are valid in their context—you don't need better definitions. You need separate contexts. Let each domain speak its truth.**

## Example 5: Starting With Domain Events

**Question**: "How do I identify domain events in a system?"

---

**The best way to understand a domain isn't asking what it *is*. It's asking what *happens*.**

I was modeling an e-learning platform. I listed entities: Course, Student, Lesson, Enrollment. Then I got stuck. How do they relate? What are the rules?

A mentor told me: "Stop asking 'what is a course?' Ask 'what happens in your system?'"

I talked to a teacher. She didn't describe courses. She described moments: "A student enrolls. They complete a lesson. They pass a quiz. They earn a certificate."

Verbs. Past tense. Things that happened.

I wrote them down as events: `StudentEnrolled`, `LessonCompleted`, `QuizPassed`, `CertificateEarned`. Then I asked: "What causes this event? What happens after?"

The model emerged from the timeline. Entities were just the things that participated in events.

**Next time you're modeling, start with a timeline. List things that happen in past tense. The events reveal the process. The process reveals the model. Structure follows story.**

## Analysis: What Makes These Work

### Common Elements Across All Examples:

1. **Strong Opening Hook**
   - Provocative statements that promise value
   - No throat-clearing or setup

2. **Specific Scenes**
   - Real people doing real things
   - Concrete details (47 columns, three days, 43 requests)
   - Physical actions (looking at screen, pulling up analytics, writing down events)

3. **Emotional Resonance**
   - Frustration: "Three more reports came in"
   - Recognition: "We'd been here before"
   - Relief: "Suddenly, three teams stopped arguing"

4. **A-ha Moments**
   - Clear turning points where understanding shifted
   - Often triggered by a question or observation

5. **Actionable Endings**
   - Specific next steps readers can take
   - Memorable principles to remember
   - Questions for reflection

6. **Show, Don't Tell**
   - Instead of "talk to experts" → shows conversation with warehouse manager
   - Instead of "avoid over-engineering" → shows deleted 3-day implementation
   - Instead of "use event sourcing" → shows overwriting problem and solution

## Anti-Examples (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Too Abstract

"Domain-Driven Design emphasizes the importance of a ubiquitous language that is shared between technical and business stakeholders. This ensures alignment and reduces miscommunication. To implement this, teams should conduct regular workshops and document key terms. The benefits include better understanding and more maintainable code."

**Why it fails:**
- No scene or story
- Pure explanation
- No emotion
- No character
- Boring
- Generic advice

---

### ❌ Too Technical

"In our microservices architecture, we implemented the Saga pattern to handle distributed transactions. We used event-driven choreography with Apache Kafka as our message broker, ensuring eventual consistency through compensating transactions. Each service publishes domain events to its own topic, and downstream services consume these events through subscription-based..."

**Why it fails:**
- Lost in technical details
- No human element
- No insight or lesson
- Not relatable to broader audience
- Too long and meandering

---

### ❌ Too Generic

"Communication is important in software development. When teams don't talk, problems arise. Make sure to have meetings and document decisions. Good practices lead to good outcomes. What are your thoughts on communication?"

**Why it fails:**
- No specific example
- Obvious advice
- No story
- No scene
- No memorable insight
- Weak call to action

## Usage Notes

When generating your own stories:

1. **Study the structure** of successful examples
2. **Notice the specificity** - numbers, names, concrete actions
3. **Feel the emotion** - where do you feel the frustration, relief, surprise?
4. **Identify the insight** - what's the one thing you remember?
5. **Examine the ending** - does it give you something actionable?

Use these examples as templates, but **never copy them**. Each story should be unique, authentic, and relevant to the specific question being answered.
