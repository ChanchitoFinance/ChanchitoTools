Your test priorities change because your risks change. What kills you today won't kill you tomorrow.

Freelancing. E-learning platform. Week one priority: Can users log in? If login breaks, nobody uses the app. We wrote 20 login tests.

Week four: Login worked perfectly. New priority: Can users actually complete a course? Analytics showed 60 percent drop-off mid-course. Login tests were useless now. We needed progress tracking tests.

Week eight: Course completion solid. New priority: Can we handle payment processing? We were about to launch paid tiers. Payment bugs could cost real money.

Three different weeks. Three different priorities. Same app.

Early-stage apps change fast. What's critical today becomes stable tomorrow. New features bring new risks.

Revisit your test priorities weekly in early stages. Test what could break your current sprint, not what worked last month. Your app evolves. Your tests should too.

Early-stage test priorities change because you're still learning what your users actually need.

At our previous startup, we launched an MVP. Day one priority: Test the sign-up flow. Without users, nothing else matters.

Week two: 500 users signed up. New problem: Nobody's using the main feature. They're all using this side feature we barely tested. Our priorities flipped overnight.

Week four: Main feature redesigned based on feedback. All our original feature tests? Worthless. The feature didn't exist anymore.

Week six: Scaling issues. App slowed with more users. New priority: Performance tests. Feature tests became secondary.

You can't predict what matters until real users touch your product.

In early stages, test what users are actually doing this week, not what you designed last month. Usage patterns reveal real priorities.

Test priorities change because you're building to learn, not building to last.

University. Final project. Mobile campus nav app. Week one: Test the map display. Core feature, right?

Week two demo with students: Nobody cared about the map. They wanted faster route calculations. "The map is pretty, but it takes 10 seconds to calculate my route."

We'd spent 40 percent of testing time on map rendering. Route calculation? Barely tested.

Priorities shifted. We rewrote route logic. Wrote 30 new tests. Deleted half our map tests.

Week four: Another shift. Students wanted offline mode. Routes and maps were useless without internet. New priority: Offline data sync.

Early stage means learning what matters. What you think is critical rarely is.

Don't lock your test suite to your first design. In early stages, be ready to throw away half your tests when you learn what users actually value.

QUESTION: How do we keep tests working in a changing codebase?

Test behavior, not implementation. Tests that check "how" break. Tests that check "what" survive.

Freelancing. Real estate platform. I wrote a test: "Verify addListing calls validateAddress, then saveToDatabase, then sendNotification."

My co-founder refactored. Changed the order. Added caching. Renamed methods. My test broke.

The listing feature still worked perfectly. But my test failed because I tested the implementation, not the behavior.

He showed me his test: "When user adds listing with valid address, listing appears in search and agent receives notification."

He refactored the same code. His test still passed. He tested the outcome, not the steps.

Implementation changes constantly in early codebases. Outcomes shouldn't.

Write tests that verify user-facing behavior and outcomes. Ignore internal implementation details. Your tests will survive refactoring, and you'll spend less time fixing broken tests that test nothing meaningful.

Integration tests survive. Unit tests die. Test at the boundaries that don't change.

Previous startup. Fintech platform. Microservices everywhere. Services changed weekly. New requirements. New features. Refactoring constantly.

Junior dev wrote 200 unit tests. Tested every internal function. Every class. Every method. Every refactor broke 50 tests.

Senior engineer wrote 40 integration tests. Tested API contracts. "When I POST to /transfer with valid data, I get 200 and money moves."

Six months later: Junior's unit tests? Ninety percent deleted or rewritten. Senior's integration tests? Thirty-eight still passing.

Internal implementation changed constantly. API contracts stayed stable.

Focus on integration and API tests in changing codebases. Test the contracts between components, not internal details. Boundaries change slowly. Implementations change fast.

Run your tests on every commit. Broken tests should stop you immediately, not surprise you later.

University. Group project. E-commerce app. We wrote tests. Then kept coding. Ran tests before the final demo.

Fifty-three tests failed. Some failed weeks ago. We had no idea which change broke what. Three days debugging before the demo.

My co-founder's freelancing client used CI. Every commit ran all tests. Build failed if any test broke.

First time he broke a test: "Commit rejected. Fix it now." Five minutes to fix. He knew exactly which change caused it.

By project end, their tests still passed. Ours were a mess.

Tests only help if they run constantly. Set up CI to run tests on every commit. Force yourself to fix broken tests immediately. A test that fails silently is worse than no test.

QUESTION: What testing tools worked best for fast dev cycles?

Fast tests beat thorough tests in fast dev cycles. If tests are slow, devs don't run them.

Freelancing. Inventory system. We used Selenium for end-to-end tests. Full browser automation. "Thorough" testing.

Each test took two minutes. Full suite: 45 minutes. Nobody ran tests locally. Too slow. We ran them in CI and hoped.

Client asked for rapid changes. We iterated fast. Tests ran once a day. By the time tests failed, we'd pushed five more changes. No idea which broke what.

We switched to Cypress. Same coverage, ten times faster. Full suite: four minutes.

Suddenly, everyone ran tests before every commit. Caught bugs immediately. Faster iterations, fewer production issues.

Pick testing tools where speed matters more than perfection. Tests developers actually run beat comprehensive tests they skip. Fast feedback loops win.

Watch mode changed everything. Tests that run automatically as you code find bugs instantly.

At our previous startup, we used Jest with watch mode. Save a file, tests run automatically. No manual command. No waiting.

I changed a function. Two seconds later: "3 tests failed." Fixed the bug. Saved. Tests passed. Total time: 30 seconds.

My co-founder used a different framework. No watch mode. He had to manually run tests after every change. "npm test." Wait. Check results.

End of day: I'd run my tests 50 times. Caught bugs immediately. He ran his tests five times. Bugs accumulated.

Same code quality standards. Different tools. Massive productivity difference.

Use testing tools with watch mode for fast dev cycles. Tests that run automatically as you code catch bugs when they're fresh in your mind. Manual test running kills momentum.

Simple tools beat powerful tools when you're moving fast. Less setup means more testing.

Freelancing. E-learning platform. Tight deadline. Client wanted e-e tests.

I suggested Playwright. Powerful. Cross-browser. Multi-language. Setup took three days. Config files. Custom helpers. Environment setup.

My co-founder suggested Testing Library. Simpler. Less powerful. Setup took 30 minutes. One config file.

Week two: I had 10 tests written. Still debugging environment issues. He had 40 tests. All passing.

Week four: His tests caught five production bugs before launch. My sophisticated setup was still being perfected.

Launch day: His simple tests saved the launch. My powerful tests were still in progress.

In fast dev cycles, pick tools you can set up in an hour. Working tests today beat perfect tests next week. Complexity kills speed.
