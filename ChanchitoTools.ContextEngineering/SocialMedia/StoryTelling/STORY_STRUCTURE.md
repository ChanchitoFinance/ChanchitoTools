# Story Structure Guide

## The 3-Part Framework

Every story MUST follow this exact structure:

### Part 1: Main Value (Opening Hook)
**Length**: 1-2 sentences (20-30 words)
**Purpose**: Immediately state the core insight or value
**Tone**: Bold, clear, provocative

**Characteristics:**
- Starts with a powerful statement or question
- Promises value to the reader
- Creates curiosity
- NO fluff or setup

**Examples:**
- "The best domain models don't start in code. They start in conversations."
- "Overengineering kills more projects than underengineering ever could."
- "Time isn't just a timestamp. It's the story of how things change."

---

### Part 2: The Story (Body)
**Length**: 120-140 words
**Purpose**: Show a real-life scene that embodies the concept
**Tone**: Personal, visual, emotional

**MUST Include:**
- **A specific scene** with sensory details
- **A character** (can be "you", "a developer", "my colleague", etc.)
- **A moment of realization** or turning point
- **Concrete actions** not abstract concepts
- **Emotional resonance** (frustration, relief, surprise, understanding)

**MUST AVOID:**
- Long explanations
- Abstract definitions
- Bullet points
- Technical jargon without context
- Lecturing tone

**Showing vs Telling:**
- ❌ TELLING: "It's important to talk to domain experts"
- ✅ SHOWING: "Sarah leaned back from her laptop, confused. Then she walked to sales and asked, 'What actually happens when a customer upgrades?' The answer changed everything."

---

### Part 3: Call to Action or Valuable Tip (Closing)
**Length**: 30-40 words
**Purpose**: Give the reader something actionable
**Tone**: Direct, helpful, empowering

**Options:**
1. **Actionable tip**: Specific next step readers can take
2. **Question for reflection**: Prompts self-examination
3. **Invitation to engage**: Asks for comments/shares
4. **Key takeaway**: Memorable principle to remember

**Examples:**
- "Next time you're stuck on a model, close your laptop. Find the person who lives in that domain every day. Listen."
- "What's one conversation you've been avoiding that might unlock your design?"
- "Remember: The goal isn't the perfect model. It's the model that helps your team move forward."
