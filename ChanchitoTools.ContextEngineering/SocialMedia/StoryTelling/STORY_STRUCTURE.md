# Content Structure Guide for Point of View Posts

## The 3-Part Framework

Every piece of content MUST follow this exact structure:

### Part 1: Opening Question (REQUIRED)
**Length**: 1 sentence
**Purpose**: Present a very specific, niche question that directly addresses a precise problem or insight
**Tone**: Specific, targeted, precise

**Characteristics:**
- Must be extremely specific and niche
- Targets a precise problem or observation
- Avoids generic or broad questions
- Creates immediate focus on a particular issue

**Examples:**
- "Why does separating domain logic from infrastructure code feel harder than it should?"
- "What happens when your team uses 'User' to mean three different things in the same codebase?"
- "Why do developers add validation everywhere except where it actually prevents bugs from reaching production?"

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Generic: "How do you write better code?"
- ❌ Vague: "What is good architecture?"
- ❌ Too broad: "How should teams collaborate?"

---

### Part 2: Core Point of View (Body)
**Length**: 100-130 words
**Purpose**: Express your clear perspective with reasoning and insight
**Tone**: Direct, confident, conversational

**MUST Include:**
- **Clear position statement** - Your perspective on the question
- **Logical reasoning** - Why you hold this view
- **Concrete observations** - General patterns you've noticed (not fabricated stories)
- **Cause-effect connections** - How things relate
- **Short, punchy sentences** for impact

**MUST AVOID:**
- Long explanations or backstory
- Fictional scenarios or stories
- Invented experiences or anecdotes
- Narrative structures with characters
- Multiple examples in one piece

**Express Point of View Through:**
- Direct statements: "X leads to Y because..."
- Pattern observations: "Every time X happens, you'll notice Y"
- Principle statements: "X isn't optional. It's how you achieve Y"
- Cause-effect logic: "If you don't have X, Y will follow"

---

### Part 3: Actionable Insight (Closing)
**Length**: 30-50 words
**Purpose**: Give readers a clear takeaway or reflection point
**Tone**: Direct, actionable, clear

**Options:**
1. **Direct recommendation**: Tell them exactly what to consider
2. **Key principle**: Memorable rule or insight
3. **Reflection question**: Encourage self-examination

**Examples:**
- "Consider how you're defining core concepts. Ambiguity at the domain level multiplies into confusion everywhere else."
- "The pattern is clear: unclear boundaries lead to tangled code. Define your boundaries early."
- "Ask yourself: Are you experiencing X because you haven't addressed Y?"

### Part 4: Hashtags (Required)
**Length**: 4-6 hashtags
**Purpose**: Increase reach and discoverability
**Placement**: After the content, separated by a blank line

**Format:**
```
[Content ends]

#code #software #[topic] #[lesson1] #[lesson2] #chanchito
```

**Examples:**
- `#code #software #architecture #domain #chanchito`
- `#code #software #teamwork #clarity #chanchito`
- `#code #software #design #principles #chanchito`

**Always include:**
- `#code` (first)
- `#software` (second)
- `#chanchito` (last)
- 1-3 topic-specific hashtags in between

## Complete Content Formula

```
[OPENING QUESTION: Very specific, niche question addressing a precise problem]

[CORE POINT OF VIEW: 100-130 words with:
 - Clear position statement
 - Logical reasoning
 - Concrete observations (general patterns, not fabricated stories)
 - Cause-effect connections
 - Short, punchy sentences]

[ACTIONABLE INSIGHT: 30-50 words giving:
 - Direct recommendation, OR
 - Key principle, OR
 - Reflection question]

[HASHTAGS: 4-6 tags]
#code #software #[topic] #[lesson] #chanchito
```

## Hard Rules

✅ **DO:**
- Keep total word count under 200 words (content + insight, excluding hashtags)
- Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Use short, punchy sentences
- Express clear points of view with confidence
- Use logical reasoning and patterns
- Focus on one single insight
- End with clear, actionable takeaway
- Always include 4-6 hashtags
- Open with very specific, niche questions

❌ **DON'T:**
- Exceed 200 words for content
- Invent experiences, stories, or scenarios
- Create fictional narratives or anecdotes
- Use generic or vague opening questions
- Over-elaborate or add unnecessary details
- Include fabricated examples
- Write lengthy explanations
- Forget hashtags
- Use more than 6 hashtags

---

## Format Specifications

### Paragraph Breaks
- Opening Question: Standalone paragraph (1 sentence)
- Core Point of View: 2-4 SHORT paragraphs with line breaks between
- Actionable Insight: Standalone paragraph (1-2 sentences)
- Hashtags: Separate line after blank line

### Line Spacing
- Single blank line between paragraphs within content
- Double blank line before hashtags

### Emphasis (Optional)
- Use **bold** sparingly for key phrases (1-2 uses max)
- Never use ALL CAPS (except for acronyms)
- Emoji use: Maximum 0-1, only if natural

### Hashtag Formatting
```
[Last sentence of content]

#code #software #topic #chanchito
```

## Examples of Good Opening Questions

**Specific and Niche:**
- "Why do teams struggle with domain boundaries when the solution is clearly defined?"
- "What causes developers to add validation in controllers instead of where it actually prevents issues?"
- "Why does 'User' mean three different things in most codebases, and what does that tell us about naming conventions?"

**Too Generic (Avoid):**
- "How do you write good code?"
- "What is architecture?"
- "How should teams work together?"

## Expressing Point of View Without Stories

Instead of: "I was debugging a problem and discovered..."
Use: "Every time X pattern appears, Y outcome follows because..."

Instead of: "We built a feature and learned that..."
Use: "The principle is clear: X leads to Y. Here's why..."

Instead of: "The bug report showed me that..."
Use: "The pattern is consistent: teams that do X experience Y because..."

Focus on insights, principles, and observable patterns - not fabricated narratives.
