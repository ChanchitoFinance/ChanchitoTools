[QUESTION TO BE INSERTED HERE]

## CONTENT STRUCTURE

### Part 1: Opening Question (REQUIRED)
**Format**: Very specific, niche question that directly addresses a precise problem or insight
**Length**: 1 sentence, as specific and targeted as possible
**Purpose**: Immediately identify the exact issue or perspective being addressed

**Examples of Specific, Niche Questions**:
- "Why does separating domain logic from infrastructure code feel harder than it should?"
- "What happens when your team uses 'User' to mean three different things?"
- "Why do developers add validation everywhere except where it actually prevents bugs?"

**AVOID Generic Questions**:
- ❌ "How do you write better code?"
- ❌ "What is good architecture?"
- ✅ "Why do code reviews catch style issues but miss architectural problems?"

### Part 2: Core Point of View (Body)
**Length**: 100-130 words
**Purpose**: Express your clear perspective on the question with reasoning and insight
**Tone**: Direct, confident, conversational

**Structure**:
- State your position clearly
- Explain the reasoning behind your perspective
- Provide concrete observations (not fictional scenarios)
- Connect to principles or patterns you've observed

**MUST Include**:
- Clear statement of your point of view
- Logical reasoning that supports your perspective
- Concrete observations or patterns (general patterns, not fabricated stories)
- Direct, punchy sentences

**MUST AVOID**:
- ❌ Inventing scenarios ("I was debugging..." when not true)
- ❌ Creating fictional experiences
- ❌ Framing hypotheticals as real events
- ❌ Story narratives with characters and scenes
- ❌ Fabricated anecdotes

**Instead, DO**:
- ✅ Express direct observations: "Every time X happens, Y occurs"
- ✅ State principles: "X always leads to Y because..."
- ✅ Share general patterns: "Teams that do X tend to experience Y"
- ✅ Provide logical reasoning: "X is important because Y follows from Z"

### Part 3: Actionable Insight (Closing)
**Length**: 30-50 words
**Purpose**: Give readers a clear takeaway or reflection point
**Tone**: Direct, actionable, clear

**Options**:
1. **Direct recommendation**: Tell readers what to consider or do
2. **Key principle**: Memorable rule or insight to remember
3. **Reflection question**: Encourage readers to examine their own situation

### Part 4: Hashtags (Required)
**Length**: 4-6 hashtags
**Format**: #code #software #[topic] #[lesson] #chanchito

## STYLE PATTERNS

### Opening Question Patterns:
- **"Why does X happen when Y should prevent it?"**
- **"What actually causes X despite everyone saying Y?"**
- **"When X occurs, why does Y always follow?"**
- **"Why do teams struggle with X when Y is supposed to solve it?"**

### Point of View Expression:
- **Direct statements**: "X leads to Y because..."
- **Pattern observations**: "Every time X happens, you'll notice Y"
- **Principle statements**: "X isn't optional. It's how you achieve Y"
- **Cause and effect**: "If you don't have X, it means Y will happen"

### Reasoning Structure:
- Start with your position
- Explain the underlying principle or pattern
- Connect to observable outcomes
- Provide the "why" behind your perspective

### Closing Patterns:
- **Directive**: "Consider X. It changes how you approach Y"

- **Reflection**: "Ask yourself: Are you experiencing X because of Y?"
